# Yellow House

This is an express app that queries the Yellow House (CR) Website, and returns the appointments for the next 8 business days

It's currently not in production to not spend money on server, there's an implementation not netlify functions so if you have something better than a free plan it should work

## Improvements
- [x] Write api endpoint
- [x] Write netlify function
- [ ] Write Google Cloud function
- [ ] Write AWS lambda function
- [ ] Cache response

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/nicolascalev/yellow-house.git
